ðŸ”¥ Our paper is accepted by IEEE Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) 2024 !!!

## Overview
CorrMatch provides a solution for mining more high-quality regions from the unlabeled images to leverage the unlabeled data more efficiently for consistency regularization.
![avatar](./images/cvpr_pipeline.png "pipeline")

Previous approaches mostly employ complicated training strategies to leverage unlabeled data but overlook the role of correlation maps in modeling the relationships between pairs of locations. Thus, we introduce two label propagation strategies (Pixel Propagation and Region Propagation) with the help of correlation maps.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:BBBBchan/CorrMatch-Jittor.git
cd CorrMatch
conda create -n corrmatch python=3.11
conda activate corrmatch
sudo apt install openmpi-bin openmpi-common libopenmpi-dev
pip install jittor
pip install opencv-python tqdm einops pyyaml matplotlib
```

### Pretrained Backbone:
[ResNet-101](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rx0legsMolCWENpfvE2jUScT3ogalMO8/view?usp=sharing)
```bash
mkdir pretrained
```
Please put the pretrained model under `pretrained` dictionary.


### Dataset:

- Pascal VOC 2012: [JPEGImages](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/voc2012/VOCtrainval_11-May-2012.tar) | [SegmentationClass](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ikrDlsai5QSf2GiSUR3f8PZUzyTubcuF/view?usp=sharing)
- Cityscapes: [leftImg8bit](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/file-handling/?packageID=3) | [gtFine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E_27g9tuHm6baBqcA7jct_jqcGA89QPm/view?usp=sharing)

Please modify the dataset path in configuration files.*The groundtruth mask ids have already been pre-processed. You may use them directly.*

Your dataset path may look like:
```
â”œâ”€â”€ [Your Pascal Path]
    â”œâ”€â”€ JPEGImages
    â””â”€â”€ SegmentationClass
    
â”œâ”€â”€ [Your Cityscapes Path]
    â”œâ”€â”€ leftImg8bit
    â””â”€â”€ gtFine
```

## Usage

### Training CorrMatch

```bash
sh tools/train.sh 
```
To run on different labeled data partitions or different datasets, please modify:

``config``, ``labeled_id_path``, ``unlabeled_id_path``, and ``save_path`` in [train.sh](https://github.com/BBBBchan/CorrMatch-Jittor/blob/main/tools/train.sh).
